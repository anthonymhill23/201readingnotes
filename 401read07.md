# 401 Read me Class 07- Python scope

  All notes taken from  [Python scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/)


The concept of scope rules how variables and names are looked up in your code. It determines the visibility of a variable within the code. The scope of a name or variable depends on the place in your code where you create that variable. The Python scope concept is generally presented using a rule known as the LEGB rule.

The letters in the acronym LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in scopes. This summarizes not only the Python scope levels but also the sequence of steps that Python follows when resolving names in a program.

In today's reading I learned 

* What scopes are and how they work in Python.
*  Why it’s important to know about Python scope.
* What the LEGB rule is and how Python uses it to resolve names.
*  How to modify the standard behavior of Python scope using global   and nonlocal.
 * What scope-related tools Python offers and how you can use them.



  With this knowledge at hand, you can take advantage of Python scopes to write more reliable and maintainable programs. Using Python scope will help you avoid or minimize bugs related to name collision as well as bad use of global names across your programs.

  ## Understanding Scopes 


  Understanding Scope
In programming, the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on. A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope. Several programming languages take advantage of scope for avoiding name collisions and unpredictable behaviors. Most commonly, you’ll distinguish two general scopes:

Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

Scope came about because early programming languages (like BASIC) only had global names. With this kind of name, any part of the program could modify any variable at any time, so maintaining and debugging large programs could become a real nightmare. To work with global names, you’d need to keep all the code in mind at the same time to know what the value of a given name is at any time. This was an important side-effect of not having scopes.

Some languages like Python use scope to avoid this kind of problem. When you use a language that implements scope, there’s no way for you to access all the variables in a program at all locations in that program. In this case, your ability to access a given name will depend on where you’ve defined that name.


## Global Scope



Modules: The Global Scope
From the moment you start a Python program, you’re in the global Python scope. Internally, Python turns your program’s main script into a module called __main__ to hold the main program’s execution. The namespace of this module is the main global scope of your program.

Note: In Python, the notions of global scope and global names are tightly associated with module files. For example, if you define a name at the top level of any Python module, then that name is considered global to the module. That’s the reason why this kind of scope is also called module scope.

If you’re working in a Python interactive session, then you’ll notice that '__main__' is also the name of its main module. To check that out, open an interactive session and type in the following:

>>> __name__
'__main__'
Whenever you run a Python program or an interactive session like in the above code, the interpreter executes the code in the module or script that serves as an entry point to your program. This module or script is loaded with the special name, __main__. From this point on, you can say that your main global scope is the scope of __main__.

To inspect the names within your main global scope, you can use dir(). If you call dir() without arguments, then you’ll get the list of names that live in your current global scope. Take a look at this code:

>>> dir()
['__annotations__', '__builtins__',..., '__package__', '__spec__']
>>> var = 100  # Assign var at the top level of __main__
>>> dir()
['__annotations__', '__builtins__',..., '__package__', '__spec__', 'var']
When you call dir() with no arguments, you get the list of names available in your main global Python scope. Note that if you assign a new name (like var here) at the top level of the module (which is __main__ here), then that name will be added to the list returned by dir().

Note: You’ll cover dir() in more detail later on in this tutorial.

There’s only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time you were to run the program, the names would remember their values from the previous run.

You can access or reference the value of any global name from any place in your code. This includes functions and classes. Here’s an example that clarifies these points:

>>> var = 100
>>> def func():
...     return var  # You can access var from inside func()
...
>>> func()
100
>>> var  # Remains unchanged
100
Inside func(), you can freely access or reference the value of var. This has no effect on your global name var, but it shows you that var can be freely accessed from within func(). On the other hand, you can’t assign global names inside functions unless you explicitly declare them as global names using a global statement, which you’ll see later on.

Whenever you assign a value to a name in Python, one of two things can happen:

You create a new name
You update an existing name
The concrete behavior will depend on the Python scope in which you’re assigning the name. If you try to assign a value to a global name inside a function, then you’ll be creating that name in the function’s local scope, shadowing or overriding the global name. This means that you won’t be able to change most variables that have been defined outside the function from within the function.

If you follow this logic, then you’ll realize that the following code won’t work as you might expect:

>>> var = 100  # A global variable
>>> def increment():
...     var = var + 1  # Try to update a global variable
...
>>> increment()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    increment()
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in increment
    var = var + 1
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'var' referenced before assignment
Within increment(), you try to increment the global variable, var. Since var isn’t declared global inside increment(), Python creates a new local variable with the same name, var, inside the function. In the process, Python realizes that you’re trying to use the local var before its first assignment (var + 1), so it raises an UnboundLocalError.

Here’s another example:

>>> var = 100  # A global variable
>>> def func():
...     print(var)  # Reference the global variable, var
...     var = 200   # Define a new local variable using the same name, var
...
>>> func()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    func()
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in func
    print(var)
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'var' referenced before assignment
You likely expect to be able to print the global var and be able to update var later, but again you get an UnboundLocalError. What happens here is that when you run the body of func(), Python decides that var is a local variable because it’s assigned within the function scope. This isn’t a bug, but a design choice. Python assumes that names assigned in the body of a function are local to that function.

Note: Global names can be updated or modified from any place in your global Python scope. Beyond that, the global statement can be used to modify global names from almost any place in your code, as you’ll see in The global Statement.

Modifying global names is generally considered bad programming practice because it can lead to code that is:

Difficult to debug: Almost any statement in the program can change the value of a global name.
Hard to understand: You need to be aware of all the statements that access and modify global names.
Impossible to reuse: The code is dependent on global names that are specific to a concrete program.
Good programming practice recommends using local names rather than global names. Here are some tips:

Write self-contained functions that rely on local names rather than global ones.
Try to use unique objects names, no matter what scope you’re in.
Avoid global name modifications throughout your programs.
Avoid cross-module name modifications.
Use global names as constants that don’t change during your program’s execution.
Up to this point, you’ve covered three Python scopes. Check out the following example for a summary on where they’re located in your code and how Python looks up names through them:

>>> # This area is the global or module scope
>>> number = 100
>>> def outer_func():
...     # This block is the local scope of outer_func()
...     # It's also the enclosing scope of inner_func()
...     def inner_func():
...         # This block is the local scope of inner_func()
...         print(number)
...
...     inner_func()
...
>>> outer_func()
100
When you call outer_func(), you get 100 printed on your screen. But how does Python look up the name number in this case? Following the LEGB rule, you’ll look up number in the following places:

Inside inner_func(): This is the local scope, but number doesn’t exist there.
Inside outer_func(): This is the enclosing scope, but number isn’t defined there either.
In the module scope: This is the global scope, and you find number there, so you can print number to the screen.
If number isn’t defined inside the global scope, then Python continues the search by looking at the built-in scope. This is the last component of the LEGB rule, as you’ll see in the next section.
