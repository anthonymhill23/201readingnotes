# Images

There are sa few different types of images. A few of the  main ones are ***JPEG***,***PNG*** and ***GIF***

## JPEG

JPEG is the default image most pictures save to. Its also the best one to use for images with a natural scene and where variation in color and intensity is smooth. You can still use it , if they arent smooth. But best practice is still best practive. 

## PNG 

PNG format is ,for any image that needs transperency or for images with text and onjects with sharp contrast edges (I.e) Logos.
PNG is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image. For this reason, a PNG image would retain higher quality than an image than JPEG and would look a lot sharper, it would also occupy more space on the disk. This makes it unsuitable for storing or transferring high-resolution digital photographs but a great choice for images with text, logos and shapes with sharp edges.


##  GIF

GIF images are actually stills of videos overlaid to make another video with no sound (normally) We use this strictly for animation pictures (funny thing, gif is spelled with a G, but pronounced with a J. That comes from the person who made the format.)
GIF is also a lossless image format that uses LZW compression algorithm. It was favoured over PNG for simple graphics in websites in its early days because the support of PNG was still growing. Given that PNG is now supported across all major devices and that PNG compression is about 5–25% better than GIF compression, GIF images are now mainly used only if the image contains animations.


## Colors and Animation 

 ### Colours
There is a significant difference in the number of colours that can be supported by these 3 formats.
JPEG images can support around 16 million colours. This is what makes them suitable for storing images of natural scenes.
PNG images mainly have two modes — PNG8 and PNG24. PNG8 can support upto 256 colours whereas PNG24 can handle upto 16 million colours like a JPEG image. Use PNG8 for simple shapes with fewer colours and PNG24 for high quality, complex logos and shapes with rounded corners on a transparent background.
GIF images are limited to 256 colours. If index transparency is used, then one of these 256 colours is assigned as transparent and the remaining 255 are used for other colours.


## Animation
Animation, in this case, refers to any change or movement in the image. It doesn’t necessarily have to have frame rates like an animated video, but essentially a part or the entire image changes with time.
Of these 3 formats, only GIF supports animation. This capability makes GIF format suitable for delivering engaging ads and banners. Of late, with the advent of companies Tumblr, 9Gag, Giphy etc. the use of GIF format for memes has picked up.
