## Django Introduction
[Getting started with Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/)

Here are a few things I got from Django. 

  Object-relational Mapper: Define your data model with python, get database access API for freeee :) (can still write SQL tho)
	- URLs and Views: Clean URL schemes! Doesn't add php or asp to urls. Create a URLconf module, it's like a table of contents for your app, creating mapping between URL patterns and your views.
	- Templates: Django's template language is designed to strike balance between power and ease. Comfortable and easy for those who've worked with HTML. 
	- Forms: Django provides a powerful library, it handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data and converting it to python. 
	- Authentication: Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. Handles user accounts, groups permissions and cookies. 
	- Admin: Django has an automatic admin interface, reads metadata in the model and provides production ready interface. 
	- Internationalization: Django provides full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers and time zones. 
	- Security: Django provides protection against, clickjacking, cross-site scripting, corss site request forgery (CSRF), SQL injection, and remote code execution.
