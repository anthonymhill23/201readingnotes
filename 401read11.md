## Jyupiter and Numpy



### Jyupter 

Jyputer can can some many formats, you also have the capability  to intergrate your terminal  along with other types of code formats.

some of the shortcuts for jurpiter are as follows

- [y] - Code mode
- [m] - markdown
- [a] - new line up
- [b] - new line down
- [c] - copy
- [v] - paste
- [x] - cut
- [z] - undo
- shift[z] - Redo
- [0] + [0] - Clear terminal/reset kernel

Create an equation by using $$. 

Shift+Enter in a code cell to run - all run in same terminal. 

### Numpy 

Numpy is a common used data analysis tool in python. 

WIth Numpy you can work in a multidimensional arraay ( I dont think we've done that, im curious to see how that would go)


Numpy can also stermine whether something is going be a float or an intergerger or float by how many bits it is

32 is an interger and 64 is afloat


a few more interesting thigs are these commands or shorthands


`int32` is 32bit

`float64` is 64 bit

`numpy.ndarray.sum` by default finds the sum of the entire array. 


`numpy.transpose` will filp the axis so x becomes y (row becoms column)

`numpy.ravel` Will turn an array into a one dimensional representation,

`numpy.reshape` can reshapoe an array to whatever size we want. 


#### Things I wanna know more about?

Id love to know who had this idea. This is a interesting thing to read, i wonder how much its going to make my brain hurt.
