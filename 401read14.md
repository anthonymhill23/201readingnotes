 [Matplotlib tutorial](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial)  Here is where I got my notes from.

 Most of the time, when useing matplotlib, youll have to reformat the data for it to work, many things may fall out the scope and so the view of the data. matplotlib has many built in tools for this. 

 [Customizing matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html)
