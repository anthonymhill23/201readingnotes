 # Chapter two
 
 In this chapter form the HTML book , several things were covered. here are a few of them

 * headings and paragraphs
 * creating bold and italics on the page
 * super script and subscript
 * white space
 * line breaks and Horizental rules

 #  Headings and paragraphs
      In this portion of the chapter, we learn about  heading and how to alter their size. We do so by  changing the number  next to the  H inside the bracket  between 1-6. 
      1 is the largest, 6 is the smallest

      paragraphs consists of one more sentences that have a self contained unit of discussion. we create a paragraph by placing a p in the bracket


  # Creating bold and italics
            by placing either a b for bold or a i for italics in brackets we can make text bold or italicized , great for ading flair or distinction to certain things on a web page.
  # superscript and subscript 
      Super script is used in reference to  mathmatical concepts such as dates or a powered number. subscript however is  generally used with footnotes or chemical formulas, super normally goes on top of  numbers, sub script goes below

  # white space
        some times we may want to have extra space inbetween our lines, so we add extra spaces like we would if writing, however, that doesnt work on PC, the coding language will automaticaly determine that its extra and condense it down. 

        <h1> Line breaks and horizental rules</h1>

        as you may have noticed a browser will auto show each new paragraphs or heading on a new line, but it is possible to make change that with a line break. you can also use horizental rules when changing themes or topics

        these are a few of the subject covered in our HTML chapter
