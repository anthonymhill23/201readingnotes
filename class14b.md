 # Googles journey to buld a perfect team

  According to the article I received, this is about a college student  named Julia Rozovsky who is assigned to a study group at Yale. In most cases, people make lifelong friends in their study group. Julia however says that it was completely  different in her case. Her group was always arguing, no one had clear roles so EVERYONE wanted to be in charge and to represent the group. There was a lot of infighting and bickering. This left julia feeling upset, because the group was very similar to her, similar upbringings and background.  
  
  
  
  
  ## New groups and opportunities
  
  As she was struggling within the study group, she started looking for other groups she could join. A classmate of hers mentioned that some students were putting together cases for "class competitions," contests in which participants proposed solutions to real world business problems. These contests were evaluated by real world judges, with cash prizes and trophies. All competitions were voluntary, but this was a very similar thing for Hulia to wrap her hear around. It wasnt much different then her current study group, Or so she thought initially.  As Julia joined the group, they all had very different backgrounds and it actually made everyone click together. 

  ##    Diversity matters. 

  Google in 2012 embarked on an initative  code named Project Aristole to figure out what made the perfect team. What made people click and work together better. To find the pattern, so to speak.  Some of the groups that ranked the most effective were groups that let go of personal views for  the team, as a collective.
