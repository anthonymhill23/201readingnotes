## Regular expressions or regex

Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not. If you've ever used search engines, search and replace tools of word processors and text editors - you've already seen regular expressions in use. They are used at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration, used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc. They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining.

This tutorial will walk you through the important concepts of regular expressions with Python. You will start with importing re - Python library that supports regular expressions. Then you will see how basic/ordinary characters are used for performing matches, followed by wild or special characters. Next, you'll learn about using repetitions in your regular expressions. You'll also learn how to create groups and named groups within your search for ease of access to matches. Next, you'll get familiar with the concept of greedy vs. non-greedy matching.

This already seems like a lot, and hence, there is a handy summary table included to help you remember what you've seen so far with short definitions. Do check it out!

This tutorial also covers some very useful functions provided by the re library, such as: compile(), search(), findall(), sub() for search and replace, split(), and some more. You will also learn about compilation flags that you can use to make your regex better.

In the end, there is a case study - where you can put your knowledge in use! So let's regex...

Regular Expressions in Python
In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. That means that if you want to start using them in your Python scripts, you have to import this module with the help of import:
